# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

My version of Udacity's Front-End Web Development Project 3 utilizing JavaScript prototypal inheritance and AABB Collision detection.

## How To Play

1. Download my project off of GitHub (Either manually or via forking)
2. Open the "index.html" in your browser of choice
3. The game will start automatically
4. Use the Arrow Keys to guide your character to the "Star Door" at the top of the screen
5. Avoid the bugs and water hazards!
6. Have fun!

## Post Mortem

Because I come from class-based langauges like C#, I chose to learn JavaScript's prototypal inheritance and implement game-functionality that way instead of taking advantage of most of the ES6 syntax. I wanted to do this because this is what ES6 syntax is doing for you and I wanted to get a better understanding of JavaScript's idiosyncrasies and how inheritance works in the opposite direction compared to class-based languages. I had a lot of fun implementing this and plan to revist this game in the future when I feel I've mastered the language and more complicated data structures. I know there is room for improvement in the code in areas like collision detection, but for now, I am happy with this project's focus being only on learning Object-oriented programming in JavaScript. Lastly, during this project I figured out a more elegant way to update and reset the modal CSS Box compared to project 2.
